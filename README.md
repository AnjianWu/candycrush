# Candy Crush Project (MIT 6.831 User Interface and Design Project)

Built the classic free-to-play puzzle video game Candy Crush using a set of core technologies that drive most modern web applications, namely HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Contributions

I was given the backend of the game logic to work with, namely:

board.js: a Javascript file containing the Board class
rules.js: a Javascript file containing the Rules class
candy.js: a Javascript file containing the Candy class
util.js: Utility functions that you may find helpful

I had to implement
index.html: UI elements
game.css: HTML element styling
game.js: UI game mechanics
graphics: images used for UI
